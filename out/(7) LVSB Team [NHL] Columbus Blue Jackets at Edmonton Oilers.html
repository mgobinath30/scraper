        The Tampa Bay Lightning and Nashville Predators are both riding three-game winning streaks as they prepare for their first meeting of the season Saturday night in Nashville.
    </p>,<p>
        On the back side of their season-long five-game homestand, the Predators appear to have found a diamond in the rough in 21-year-old rookie Juuso Parssinen.
    </p>,<p>
        A seventh-round pick in 2019 (210th overall), Parssinen has blossomed into a point-producer in his first three matches after being recalled from AHL affiliate Milwaukee on Nov. 12.
